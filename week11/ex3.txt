output of the first program:
Hello
Hello
output of the second program:
Hello


Behaviour of programs:
for the first programm:
1)Program puts "Hello" in the buffer
2)Process forks
3)parent and child process have the same buffer
4)Process flushes buffer and outputs "Hello"
5)Another process flushes the buffer and outputs "Hello"

for the second program:
1)Programm puts "Hello\n" in the buffer
2)then it flushes the buffer couse of "\n"
3)process forks
4)first ptocess outputs "\n"
5)second ptocess outputs "\n"
