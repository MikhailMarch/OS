when we have more references to the same page in the input file the hit/miss
rete will increase, but when referenced pages are different the retion will 
decrease
In the 1st execise I tryied the programm with different numger of page frames, when the
number was lagreg -> hit/miss rate was bigger, as the structure stored more
pages and probability of hit with incoming reference was bigger
